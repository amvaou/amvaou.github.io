Hello! I’m **Anna Maria Vaou**, an Integrated Masters of Architecture student at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). My passion lies in combining innovative architectural design with advanced computational tools to create dynamic and inspiring spaces.

I specialize in geometric visualization and parametric design, as showcased through my projects like **Modular Construction Through Origami** and **Algorithmic Organization Systems** using GeoGebra. My academic journey, along with my experience at Moraitis School, has enriched my skills and broadened my perspective on design and technology.

Outside the classroom, I actively engage in various extracurricular activities:
- **Student Volunteer Animal Welfare Group** (2015–2024)
- **Student Cultural Club** (2018–2021)
- **High School Newspaper Editor** (Honorary distinction, 2018–2021)
- **Captain of the Volleyball Team** at Moraitis School (2015–2021)

I also enjoy connecting with like-minded individuals online. Check out my favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com) for some engaging discussions.
